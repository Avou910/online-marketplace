# PROJECT SUMMARY
The final project of the web programming course involved building an online marketplace where users could post items for sale. The project required building both the front-end and back-end of the application using React, Node, and a SQL database, and deploying it.

The result was a functional marketplace app with a React front-end, Node.js back-end, and MySQL database. The app was deployed using Render, making it reachable to users. Overall, the project provided valuable experience in developing a full-stack application and deploying it to a cloud service.
